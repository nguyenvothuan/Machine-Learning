# MACHINE LEARNING
This is a collection of 5 models including kNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Neural Network built from scratch in my free time.  
In each folder, there will be:  
- A dataset folder that holds datasets to train and test each model.  
- Source code. In order to run this code, you will need an IDE (I am using PyCharm) and install the packages used there.
- A readme that contains resulting plots and curves after testing each model against the test set, along with my brief analysis on the performance and behavior of this particular algorithm.
